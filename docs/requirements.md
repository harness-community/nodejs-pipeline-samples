### Make sure you have the following set up before you begin this tutorial:

- Github account: This tutorial clones a codebase from a Github repo. You will need a Github account so Harness can connect to Github.
- Docker Hub account and repo: You will need to push and pull the image you build to Docker Hub. You can use any repo you want, or create a new one for this tutorial.
- Kubernetes cluster for Harness Delegate and build farm: You'll need a Kubernetes cluster for Harness to use for the Harness Delegate and as a build farm. Ensure you have a cluster that meets the following requirements:
- Number of pods: 3 (two pods for the Harness Delegate, the remaining pod for the build farm).
- Machine type: 4vCPU
- Memory: 16GB RAM. The build farm and Delegate requirements are low but the remaining memory is for Kubernetes, the Docker container, and other default services.
- Networking: Outbound HTTPS for the Harness connection, and to connect to Docker Hub. Allow TCP port 22 for SSH.
- Namespace: When you install the Harness Delegate, it will create the harness-delegate namespace. You'll use the same namespace for the build farm.
- A Kubernetes service account with permission to create entities in the target namespace is required. The set of permissions should include list, get, create, and delete permissions. In general, the cluster-admin permission or namespace admin permission is enough.
